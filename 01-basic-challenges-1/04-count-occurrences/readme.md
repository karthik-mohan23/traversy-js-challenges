# Challenge: Count Occurrences

## Instructions

Write a function called `countOccurrences()` that takes in a string and a character and returns the number of occurrences of that character in the string.

### Function Signature

```js
/**
 * Returns the number of occurrences of a character in a string.
 * @param {string} str - The string to search.
 * @param {string} char - The character to search for.
 * @returns {number} - The number of occurrences of the character in the string.
 */
function countOccurrences(str: string, char: string): number;
```

### Examples

```js
countOccurrences("hello", "l"); // 2
countOccurrences("hello", "z"); // 0
```

### Constraints

- Lowercase and uppercase characters are considered different characters. If you want, you can make the function case insensitive

### Hints

- You can loop through a string just like you can loop through an array.
- You can use the `++` operator to increment a variable.
- You could take another approach and use the `split()` method to split the string into an array of substrings based on the given character.

```JavaScript
function countOccurrences(str, char) {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === char) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
}

// Case insensitive version
// function countOccurrences(str, char) {
//   const lowerStr = str.toLowerCase();
//   const lowerChar = char.toLowerCase();

//   let count = 0;

//   for (let i = 0; i < lowerStr.length; i++) {
//     if (lowerStr[i] === lowerChar) {
//       count++;
//     }
//   }

//   return count;
// }

```

### Explanation

- Initialize a `count` variable to 0.

- Iterate through the string and check if the current character is equal to the character we're looking for. If it is, we increment the `count` variable.

- After the loop, we return the `count` variable.

- To make the function case insensitive, we can convert the string and character to lowercase before looping through the string.

```JavaScript
const countOccurrences = (str, char) => str.split(char).length - 1;
```

### Explanation

-If there is one occurrence of the separator, there will be two substrings. For example, splitting "hello,world" with , gives two substrings: "hello" and "world".
If there are n occurrences of the separator, there will be n + 1 substrings.

-Adjustment by 1:

To find the number of occurrences of the separator within the string, you count the number of substrings generated by splitting and subtract 1.
The subtraction of 1 accounts for the fact that the number of substrings is always one more than the number of occurrences of the separator.
For example, in the string "hello,world", there is one comma, which results in two substrings. However, there's only one occurrence of the comma.
Therefore, by subtracting 1 from the length of the array generated by split(), we accurately calculate the number of occurrences of the character char within the string str.

This solution may be prettier, but it actually is not as efficient as the loop. The for loop solution directly counts the occurrences while iterating through the string, whereas the split solution involves splitting the string into an array and performing additional operations. The difference is negligible, but it is still good to be aware of.

### Test Cases

```js
test("Count Occurrences of a Character", () => {
  expect(countOccurrences("hello", "l")).toBe(2);
  expect(countOccurrences("programming", "m")).toBe(2);
  expect(countOccurrences("banana", "a")).toBe(3);
});
```
